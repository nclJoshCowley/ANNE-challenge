# ANNE-challenge

ANNE (Analyst Network North East) produced the following challenge for students
in the North East of England in collaboration with NEECCo (North East England
Climate Coalition) and NICD (National Innovation Centre for Data).

> The Challenge is to produce an indicator or a small set of indicators related
> to climate change or environmental sustainability, specifically for the
> North East of England. By 'indicator', we mean something that measures the
> value of or change in a particular variable, such as the presence of a
> species, the quality of water, or the uptake of cycle-to-work schemes.
>
> You are welcome to approach the Challenge in any way you like, but as a
> general approach, we'd recommend:
>
> 1. Select a subject/topic to develop an indicator for. NEECCo's
>    subject-matter experts in land, water and housing will be on hand to answer
>    questions, but you are welcome to choose any topic that interests you.
>    NEECCo has already developed a dashboard of indicators â€“ can you see a gap
>    in what they've produced, or is there something in their dashboard you
>    think you could advance?
>
> 1. Identify data to measure your chosen subject. To find this data, you can
>    check out NICD's list of related sources (see the resources section below),
>    approach one of NEECCo's subject-matter experts, or search online. If you
>    cannot identify appropriate data, we suggest going back to step one and
>    choosing a new subject to explore.
>
> 1. Analyse the data and develop an indicator. What does the data tell you
>    about climate change and environmental sustainability in the North East?
>    Is there something in the data that would be interesting to monitor over
>    time?
>
> 1. Visually represent your indicator. This could be a visualisation (such as
>    a graph or map) on a static page (such as a PDF or R markdown report) or
>    on an interactive dashboard (such as a Power BI or R Shiny app). We
>    welcome you to get creative or possibly even artistic here!
