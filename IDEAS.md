# Ideas

## Overall Approach

To narrow down such a wide array of possibilities I aimed to draft one or two
ideas for each expert field: land, water and housing before looking into any
data. Then, I will narrow down the options to a single project based upon my 
opinion and the quality of the data available.

Unfortunately, this made my task much harder and after several hours of
researching, I decided to pivot to a data-first approach.

The analysis visualisation is likely to be a Shiny application due to my
strengths and the overall professional feel of well-made Shiny applications,
this will also be taken into account at the project decision point.

## Housing - EPC Upgrading

### Motivation

- EPC ratings show which houses have worst detrimental environmental impact,
- Livin wants to take many EPC C-D housing to EPC A,
- What defines EPC levels?
- Housing accounts for ~20% of carbon emissions in UK,
- Difficulty in knowing environmental cost of retrofit.

### Research

Easier retrofits have been underway, deeper and more disruptive retrofitting
seems required.

> To make the necessary significant impact, much deeper retrofits will be
> required, and the scale, cost and challenge of deployment should not be
> underestimated. [(Energy Efficiency of Existing Homes)][ukparliament2021].

For example, insulation in solid wall properties.

> Most homes left to insulate will need more expensive measures, see figure in
> report [(Reinventing retrofit)][greenalliance2021].

Disruption is a main concern of inhabitants or owners responsible for said
inhabitants.

> But cost is not the sole, or even most important factor for people. Hassle
> and aesthetics are at least as important. The current policy approach does
> not take this into account [(Reinventing retrofit)][greenalliance2021].

### Idea

A simple metric for greener housing would quantify how far away a property is
from being carbon neutral or at least EPC A. However, this would not
detail the social and/or economic cost of transforming to that point.
Aim to create a measure that describes work required (inhabitant disruption,
economic cost, skill shortage) to achieve some ideal environmental level.

## Water - Phosphorous

### Motivation

- Rivers Trust has information on what it has done, would like an indicator
  that reflects the impacts of their actions
- They claim the biggest culprit of water pollution is agriculture.
- A dashboard showing sewage leaks exists on their website.
- Looking into "catchment pollution" leads to multiple news outlets mentioning
  sewage overflow (CSOs) and public outcry against the frequency of such.
- Phosphorous is a major pollutant that comes from sewage and agriculture
  with adverse health effects.

### Research

Channel 4 news summarises the sewage issue really well in the video:
"900,000 hours of human sewage and rainwater flow into UK rivers in just one
year - revealed", [(Channel 4, 2020))](channel4news)
