# Ideas

## Overall Approach

To narrow down such a wide array of possibilities I aim to draft one or two
ideas for each expert field: land, water and housing before looking into any
data.
One I set of possible projects I will then narrow down to a single project
based upon my opinion and the quality of the data available.

The analysis visualisation is likely to be a Shiny application due to my
strengths and the overall professional feel of well-made Shiny applications,
this will also be taken into account at the project decision point.
