# Ideas

## Overall Approach

To narrow down such a wide array of possibilities I aim to draft one or two
ideas for each expert field: land, water and housing before looking into any
data.
One I set of possible projects I will then narrow down to a single project
based upon my opinion and the quality of the data available.

The analysis visualisation is likely to be a Shiny application due to my
strengths and the overall professional feel of well-made Shiny applications,
this will also be taken into account at the project decision point.

## Housing - EPC Upgrading

### Motivation

- EPC ratings show which houses have worst detrimental environmental impact,
- Livin wants to take many EPC C-D housing to EPC A,
- What defines EPC levels?
- Housing accounts for ~20% of carbon emissions in UK,
- Difficulty in knowing environmental cost of retrofit.

### Research

Easier retrofits have been underway, deeper and more disruptive retrofitting
seems required.

> To make the necessary significant impact, much deeper retrofits will be
> required, and the scale, cost and challenge of deployment should not be
> underestimated. [(Energy Efficiency of Existing Homes)][ukparliament2021].

For example, insulation in solid wall properties.

> Most homes left to insulate will need more expensive measures, see figure in
> report [(Reinventing retrofit)][greenalliance2021].

Disruption is a main concern of inhabitants or owners responsible for said
inhabitants.

> But cost is not the sole, or even most important factor for people. Hassle
> and aesthetics are at least as important. The current policy approach does
> not take this into account [(Reinventing retrofit)][greenalliance2021].

### Idea

A simple metric for greener housing would quantify how far away a property is
from being carbon neutral or at least EPC A. However, this would not
detail the social and/or economic cost of transforming to that point.
Aim to create a measure that describes work required (inhabitant disruption,
economic cost, skill shortage) to achieve some ideal environmental level.
